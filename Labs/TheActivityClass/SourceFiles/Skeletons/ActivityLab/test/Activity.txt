Q: 	Suppose the user starts the application, which brings up ActivityOne. Next, suppose the user
	presses the Button to start ActivityTwo, and that ActivityTwo then appears on the screen.

	List the Activity lifecycle methods that have been invoked on ActivityOne and on
	ActivityTwo, since the application started, in the order that they occurred.
	
R:	Activity one		-- wrong
		onCreate()
		onStart()
		onResume()
		onPause()
	
	Activity two
		onCreate()
		onStart()
		onResume()
		
A:	Lab-ActivityOne(3117): Entered the onCreate() method
	Lab-ActivityOne(3117): Entered the onStart() method
	Lab-ActivityOne(3117): Entered the onResume() method
	Lab-ActivityOne(3117): Entered the onPause() method
	
	Lab-ActivityTwo(3117): Entered the onCreate() method
	Lab-ActivityTwo(3117): Entered the onStart() method
	Lab-ActivityTwo(3117): Entered the onResume() method
	
	Lab-ActivityOne(3117): Entered the onStop() method

Q:	Next, suppose the user navigates back to ActivityOne by pressing the “Close Activity”
	Button of ActivityTwo. ActivityTwo closes and then ActivityOne reappears. Starting where
	you left off after the previous step:
	
	List the Activity lifecycle methods that have been invoked on ActivityOne and on
	ActivityTwo, in the order they occurred.
	
R:	Activity two		-- wrong
		onPause()
		onStop()
		onDestroy()
		
	Activity one
		onResume()	
		
A:	Lab-ActivityTwo(3117): Entered the onPause() method

	Lab-ActivityOne(3117): Entered the onRestart() method
	Lab-ActivityOne(3117): Entered the onStart() method
	Lab-ActivityOne(3117): Entered the onResume() method
	
	Lab-ActivityTwo(3117): Entered the onStop() method
	Lab-ActivityTwo(3117): Entered the onDestroy() method	

		
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:	Next, the user presses the Button to start ActivityTwo again. Once ActivityTwo appears, the
	user presses the Home Key on the device. Starting where you left off after the previous step:
	
	List the Activity lifecycle methods that have been invoked on ActivityOne and on
	ActivityTwo, in the order they occurred.
		
R:	Activity one:		-- correct
		onPause()
	
	Activity two:	
		onCreate()
		onStart()
		onResume()
	
	Activity one:
		onStop()
		
	Activity two:
		onPause()
		onStop()	

		
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:	Next, the user starts the application again, by clicking on its icon in the Launcher. Once the
	application has restarted, and starting where you left off after the previous step:
	
	List the Activity lifecycle methods that have been invoked on ActivityOne and on
	ActivityTwo, in the order they occurred.
	
R:	Activity two:		-- correct
		onRestart()
		onStart()
		onResume()
